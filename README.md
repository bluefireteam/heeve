# Heeve

You are the leader of a peaceful bug-like beings civilization, living your
lives and improving your society when suddenly, a strange race of aliens
which call themselves humans invade your planet and start to consume its
resources. It is your job to lead the swarm and repel those weird, fragile
creatures and save your home. They might have advanced technologies, but we
have the might of the hive!

## Music
A big thanks to our great composer Valentino Cervini, without him realizing it
without him we wouldn't have managed to get this game out.
